> **Past simple** vs **Past continuous**
> 
> Past Simple:
> 
> - Used for actions that were completed in the past.
> - Indicates a single event or a series of completed events.
> - Often accompanied by specific time expressions.
> - Example: "She cooked dinner last night."
> 
> Past Continuous:
> 
> - Used for actions that were ongoing or in progress in the past.
> - Emphasizes the duration or temporary nature of the action.
> - Often used with a past simple action to provide context.
> - Example: "She was cooking dinner when the phone rang."
> 
> In summary, use the past simple when describing completed actions in the past, and use the past continuous to emphasize actions that were ongoing or in progress at a specific time in the past. Pay attention to the context and the time expressions used to determine which tense is appropriate.

> **Gone** vs **Been**
> 
>"Gone" and "been" are both past participles of the verb "go," but they are used differently in sentences:
> 
> 1. Gone:
> 
> - "Gone" is used in sentences that emphasize the action of going away or moving to a location and not returning.
> - It is often used with "have" to form the present perfect tense (e.g., "I have gone to the store").
> - Example: "He has gone to the park."
> - It can also be used as an adjective (e.g., "The cake is gone").
> 
> 2. Been:
> 
> - "Been" is used to indicate that someone has visited a place or experienced something. It emphasizes the completion of the visit or experience.
> - It is also used with "have" to form the present perfect tense (e.g., "She has been to Paris").
> - Example: "I have been to that restaurant before."
> - "Been" is also used to form the past perfect tense (e.g., "He had been to the museum before").
> 
>  In short, "gone" emphasizes the action of going away, while "been" emphasizes the experience of having visited a place or having done something. Both are past participles of the verb "go," but they are used in different contexts.

# Unit 18

> **Present Continuous** vs **Present perfect continuous**
> 
>Both the present continuous and the present perfect continuous are tenses used in English grammar to describe actions or situations, but they are used in slightly different contexts:
>
> 1. Present Continuous (Present Progressive):
> 
> - Used to describe actions that are happening right now, at the moment of speaking.
> - It can also be used to describe temporary actions or situations that are ongoing around the present time.
> - Example: "I am reading a book."
> - Structure: Subject + am/is/are + present participle (-ing form of the verb)
> 
> 2. Present Perfect Continuous:
> 
> - Used to describe actions that started in the past and have continued up to the present moment. It focuses on the duration of the action.
> - It also emphasizes the result or the outcome of the action.
> - Example: "I have been reading this book for an hour."
> - Structure: Subject + have/has + been + present participle (-ing form of the verb)
> 
> In short, the present continuous is used to describe actions happening right now or around the present moment, while the present perfect continuous is used to describe actions that started in the past and have continued up to the present moment, often with an emphasis on the duration of the action.
